- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m @stremyjo
- 👀 I’m interested in coding more using python and finding cool projects or datasets to complete exploratory data analysis on.
- 🌱 I’m currently working more with R and python and hope to become proficient in both by December. I am proficient in SQL, SPSS, Excel and R for data analysis and statistics. I am currently learning more python and aiming to complete a few projects to improve my skillset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any exploratory data analysis projects, data cleaning, and anything else that can help  me develop my skills.
- As for hobbies, I love to play video games 🎮 , read 📚 and draw ✍️. I have some web development experience and want to eventually expand to fun projects in these areas next.
