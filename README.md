- 👋 Hi, I’m @stremyjo
- 👀 I’m interested in learning python and finding cool projects or datasets related to healthcare (my passion) to complete exploratory data analysis on.
- 🌱 I’m currently working more with R and python and hope to become proficient in both by December. I am proficient in SQL, Excel and R for data analysis and statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any exploratory data analysis projects, data cleaning, and anything else that can help  me develop my skills.
